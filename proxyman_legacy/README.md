# About proxyman

Previously, I use propyman to forward the API request, but now it is replaced by Chrome extensions.

Chrome extension has following advantages:

- Don't rely on system (proxyman can only run on macOS)
- Easier to config
- Proxyman is not free, but Chrome extension is free
- No cache problem
